# CudnnLSTM-test
Testing the CUDA implementation of the LSTM cell with tensorflow bindings. 
It was very hard to find worked examples of using the CUDNN hooks in tensorflow, so a full example on synthetic data is provided here, including user-specified initialization. 

There is also assorted code for use in the PLR project with Eric Martin: paper available [here](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkHEwdgCZ)
